# Compiler-for-C-language

This is a simple compiler for C language.
The target machine is a MIPS32 machine. You can find a simulator for a MIPS machine here: http://spimsimulator.sourceforge.net/

Instructions to run: just put the code to be compiled in the test.c file and run make

We have added some complicated samples in the "our samples" directory
